# Auth

Authentication is host-level infrastructure. Authorization and identity-dependent mapping are part of the slice behavior when they affect a request.

## Direction

Tooyioo delegates human authentication to an external OpenID Connect provider.

Google is the first provider because it keeps early product authentication simple and avoids storing user passwords or password-reset credentials in Tooyioo. This is an implementation choice, not a domain dependency. The intended direction is that the API can later move to another delegated OpenID Connect mechanism, such as Auth0 or a similar identity platform, without forcing most slices to understand Google-specific claims.

The API boundary should therefore distinguish:

- external identity claims, such as provider `iss` and `sub`
- app-owned identity claims, such as `user_onboarding_id` and `user_id`
- app authorization facts, such as roles, scopes, organization membership, or permissions when those are introduced

Most endpoints should authorize from app-owned claims on the authenticated principal. They should not depend on Google-specific claims directly.

The main exception is `InitiateUserOnboarding`. That slice must consume external identity and personal-detail claims because its purpose is to turn a trusted external identity into a Tooyioo onboarding process.

## JWT claims

JWT claims should remain honest.

Do not mutate the identity token into something it is not. The token represents the external identity provider's claims.

For Google-style identity tokens, relevant claims include:

- `sub`
- `iss`
- `given_name`
- `family_name`
- `email`
- `email_verified`

Slices may read `ClaimsPrincipal` when the request behavior depends on authenticated identity.

## App-owned claims

The application may enrich the authenticated principal with app-owned claims after token validation.

Examples:

- known onboarding status
- known user id
- known user onboarding id

These claims are Tooyioo facts, not Google facts. Keep that distinction clear.

After onboarding has started or completed, slice authorization should prefer these app-owned claims:

- use `user_onboarding_id` for onboarding-only workflows
- use `user_id` for fully onboarded user workflows

Completed users may carry both claims. This allows idempotent onboarding endpoints to authorize retries by `user_onboarding_id` while fully onboarded workflows authorize by `user_id`.

This keeps the application authorization model stable if the upstream identity provider changes.

## Provider evolution

The current host validates Google identity tokens directly. A future provider can replace that direct Google validation as long as it produces a trusted `ClaimsPrincipal` with the app-owned claims that Tooyioo endpoints require.

Possible future shapes include:

- an external identity platform federating to Google and issuing API tokens for Tooyioo
- a Tooyioo token exchange endpoint that verifies an external identity token and issues short-lived app tokens
- a separate machine-to-machine credential flow for non-human API clients

Provider-specific parsing should stay near authentication infrastructure or the onboarding initiation boundary. Business slices should receive an already authenticated principal with Tooyioo claims.

## Personal details

If personal details come from the identity token, parse them from the claims principal.

Do not introduce a separate personal-details retriever unless the source is genuinely different from the token, for example a separate provider userinfo API call, a privacy transform, or a provider-specific normalization flow.

## Tests

Tests should use real signed JWTs with a test signing key.

The vertical slice test host overrides JWT bearer options so tests do not depend on Google metadata, production issuer validation, or production audience validation.

Keep signing key validation and lifetime validation enabled in tests. This catches malformed token setup without making tests external.
